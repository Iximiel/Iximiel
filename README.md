This is my presentation, stuck to the template...

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Iximiel, or Daniele if you prefer. I have studied physics and in particular i dedicated my Master Thesis and my PhD to computational physics. I studied the optimization of naonalloys in the MT and worked on developin a Au-S atomistic potential during my PhD.
- 👀 I’m interested in physics, computational physiscs and chemistry, optimization algorithms and optimization of algorithms, and on a less work-related way in videogames, tabletops games, game design and storytelling (both in games and in other media), also i like to build small miniatures and doing some electronic projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and improving my C++ skills and some python (altough i use python more as a scripting language than a programming language). I'm working on improving my skill on tralslating ideas in code.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on physics and or optimization projects, and in some kind of project in which i have no experience, to grow.
- 📫 How to reach me: my private e-mail is iximiel [at] gmail [dot] com
