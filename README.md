Hi, Iâ€™m @Iximiel, or Daniele if you prefer.

I am a Physicist by education, software developer/engineer by vocation.

My current role is to convince some component of [PLUMED](https://www.plumed.org/) to run on the GPU, at SISSA.
Previously I helped keeping in order (and well documented) the internal scripts libraries of my laboratories.

My job was always in translating or in interfaces:

- Physics is the science that makes nature understandable by a human being by using the math as a language
- I ported a global optimization program from Fortran to C++ [BH++ can be found here](https://bitbucket.org/Iximiel/bh/src/master/)
- I tried to fit a potential to describe the Au -- S interface in nanoparticles
- I interfaced real PhD students (that by definition NEVER read manuals) with atomic structure analysis python packages [here](https://github.com/Iximiel/SOAPify)
- Now I am translating part of the [PLUMED](https://www.plumed.org/) code to run it on the GPU
- I also helped in making possible to call a Python script with and embedded (in PLUMED) Python interpreter by a PLUMED instance [that runs within a Python interpreter](https://github.com/plumed/plumed2/pull/1134)

I am primarly a C++ developer, I have a love-hate relationship with Python and I do like setting up bash scripts (I can use arrays!).
I am familiar with CMake and with writing Makefiles, I also have the basis to interact with Autotools

ðŸ“« my private e-mail is iximiel [at] gmail [dot] com

ðŸ‘€ I do like talking about and interacting with videogames, tabletops games, game design and storytelling.
